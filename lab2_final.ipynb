    "## About the Movielens data\n",
    "Movielens (https://movielens.org/) is a movie recommendation service run by the Grouplens (http://grouplens.org/) team at the University of Minnesota. Over the years, the service has been growing considerably, and once every few years, Grouplens releases new anonymized usage data to the community (http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), which have become de facto benchmarking standards in the Recommender Systems research community.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1998, the first released dataset consisted of 100,000 ratings (1000 users, 1700 movies). The most recently released benchmark dataset (2014) consisted of 20 million ratings (138,000 users, 27,000 movies).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current lab session, we will not focus on the big data crunching, but rather on getting a better practical feeling on how to handle user-item data, as well as the implications of Matrix Factorization."
